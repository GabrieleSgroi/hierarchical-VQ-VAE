# Hierarchical-VQ-VAE
## Introduction
Custom implementation of a hierarchical Vector Qantized Variational Autoencoder based on the concepts introduced in [ Generating Diverse High-Fidelity Images with VQ-VAE-2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.00446.pdf) and relative PixelCNN priors. The model and the PixelCNN priors are customized such that they can be trained, retaining reasonable performance for large 512x512 images, on free TPU and GPU machines offered on Kaggle and Colab. The model has been trained on the image data of the Kaggle competition [Humpback Whale Identification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/humpback-whale-identification) as this dataset offered a reasonable number of high resolution images.
